### App Features ✨

🔢 Pagination.
❔ Custom 404 page.
🏃‍♂️ Dynamic routing.

🔎 Debounce input search.
📱 Responsive layout (desktop, tablet and mobile).
⭐ Saving characters and episodes as favorites using localStorage with Redux Toolkit (data persistence).

### Conclusions 🧙‍♂️

Although the project works great considering the fact that was developed really fast, I'll get around to making changes like refactoring some pieces of code related to the services, adding the color mode change and other fun things, to make this app more performant.
